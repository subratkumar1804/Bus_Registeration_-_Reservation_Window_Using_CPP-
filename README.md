# Bus_Registeration_-_Reservation_Window_Using_CP
This project is based on the concept of object-oriented programming(OOPs) in C++. Here we register new buses, book the seats and check the availability of different buses on different routes.

This project is based on the concept of object oriented programming(OOPs) in C++.
Here in this project Bus Registration and Reservation Window we will be understanding about OOPs concept in C++ with the use of classes and objects.
In this project we can register new buses on various routes with flexible timings and can book the seats of users choice in different buses which are classified on the basis of bus numbers
and can check availability of different buses on different routes.

--------------------------------------------------
##Software Requirements:

1.Dev C++(Application installed on windows)
download link of this application on windows:https://bloodshed-dev-c.en.softonic.com/

--------------------------------------------------
##Purpose of this project:

The main purpose of this project is to help beginners understand about OOPs concept in C++ with use of classes and objects and 
their data members and member functions.

The main purpose of using OOPs concept is that it makes the program easier to understand, makes it more flexible and easy to maintain.
The operations on data members and their member functions can be carried out in such a manner that it provides the main advantage of code reuseability.

The basic functions applied on the object:
1.Resgister.
2.Seat Allotment.
3.Check Seat Availabilty.
4.Check Buses on different routes.

--------------------------------------------------
##Fuctionality of the project:

For running the program you can use DEV-C++ IDE.

After running this program first you will see the welcome screen, you need to PRESS ENTER key to enter into the main menu screen.

In MAIN MENU some fuctions are:
Press 1-To register your bus on a particular route.
Press 2-To book seat for passengers on a particular bus classified on the basis of bus numbers.
Press 3-To show availability of seats in a bus classified on the basis of bus number.
Press 4-To see number of buses available on different routes.
Press 5-To exit from the application at any time.

This program provides you the flexibility to use any of the above keys ant any
position of the program but before using any other function the mandatory condition is to register your bus first.

--------------------------------------------------
##TROUBLESHOOTING:

1.If the program does not runs then you need to check the keys used while giving your input, if certain other keys are used by mistake you 
will not be able to give input or start printing.
2. Check that proper software is installed on your windows.
